# digital-invention-dice
Inspired from Atomic Shrimp's invention cube. Also serves as a simpler exercise for integrating PWA. For more information about the inspiration, you can read more about it in [this link](http://atomicshrimp.com/post/2014/01/20/Invention-Dice). There's also a video from the creator of this idea which you can see it [right here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBdVpiWUKhU).
