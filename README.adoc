= virtual-invention-dice
Inspired from Atomic Shrimp's invention cube. Also serves as a simpler 
exercise for integrating PWA. 

For more information about the inspiration, you can read more about it 
in http://atomicshrimp.com/post/2014/01/20/Invention-Dice[this link]. 
There's also a video from the creator of this idea which you can 
see it https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBdVpiWUKhU[right here].

== Demo

== Features of the app
* It's mostly built as an offline app so once you've visited the app, you'll be 
ready to go. No installation required. 
** Being a 
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps/Introduction[progressive web app (PWA)], 
you can even make it _almost_ like a native mobile app on your phone
by adding the app page into the home screen.

* Defining your own set of virtual idea dice set (or VIDS, as I call them).

* Storing VIDS in IndexedDB (with https://localforage.github.io/localForage/[localforage]).

* Import and export of VIDS with a JSON file
** You can see some sample dice sets in the link:examples/[`examples/` directory] and import 
them to see it. Be sure to export your dice set first since the app can only have one set 
(at least for now).

* Saving dice results in IndexedDB (with https://localforage.github.io/localForage/[localforage]).

== Development build
If you want to open this app locally on your machine, just do the following:

* clone this repo or download the zip of this repo provided
* fetch the files from the dev (`develop`) branch
* install all of the dependencies needed (`npm i`)
* open the app over `localhost` with `npm run serve`

Aaaaaaaand voila! It's open now! üòÅ

=== Extra
Also, for future references:

* Node v11.3.0
* npm 6.4.1

== Contribution
If you want to contribute or just add features that you want, take note of the following configurations:

* created with https://cli.vuejs.org/guide/[Vue CLI] 
and the https://router.vuejs.org/[official Vue router library]

* uses http://tailwindcss.com/[Tailwind CSS] for most of the CSS

* uses https://github.com/eslint/eslint[ESLint] and it has the 
https://github.com/standard/standard[standard style guide] as the configuration

* all of the usual configurations and constants like the routes, app information, 
and the author are located in link:src/constants.js[`./src/constants.js`], I've made it 
so that I can update it easily in one place

=== Code
If you want to contribute through code, you can look at the link:docs/CHANGELOG.adoc[changelog] 
in the dev (`develop`) branch for the latest features that has been implemented so far. 
Also, it contains some future features that is to be considered.

=== Documentation
If you want to contribute through writing and/or improving documentations, have a quick look at 
https://asciidoctor.org/[Asciidoctor] since it is the formatting language used for writing docs 
around here. It's basically a (more comprehensive) alternative to Markdown. 

Speaking of Markdown, you can take a good look 
https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#compared-to-markdown[here] 
if you're familiar with Markdown for a quick start.

=== Issues
If you want to report bugs or suggest a feature, you can file an issue in the 
https://github.com/foo-dogsquared/virtual-idea-dice/issues[issue tracker]. 

Just make sure the title is brief and concise with the type of issue you're 
filing (bug, feature, enhancement, etc.) and leave all the details in the 
body of the issue.

for the main inspiration for this project. Also, I've got this

by the man behind the idea himself. :)

== Todo
* Multiple virtual idea dice set (VIDS) support

* A VIDS ranking system (see https://github.com/foo-dogsquared/virtual-idea-dice/issues/7[this issue])
-- This is mostly be implemented as an optional feature since the app is built to be offline and this 
mostly requires the user to be online. Though with online capability, it is yet to be one of 
the biggest features to be implemented so far.

* Improve UI/UX
-- I especially need some help from this one. ;-;
